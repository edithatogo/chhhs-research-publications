# G08 review

Review status: in progress; local planning and idempotency contracts are implemented.

- `validate_policy` requires a version, organisation, anchor, lead time, holiday-calendar version and effective dates.
- `delivery_event_key` gives future notifications a stable deduplication key; it does not send messages or create calendar events.
- Existing subscription matching remains candidate generation only and does not authorize delivery.

Native funding pages, authenticated preference persistence, personal access isolation, calendar update/cancellation and notification delivery remain open.
