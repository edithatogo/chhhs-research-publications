# Track Review: E01 Power Automate Ingestion Canonicalization and Recurrence Scheduling

## Implementation Summary
1. **Flow Definition Canonicalized:**
   - File: `config/flows/publication-registry-upsert.definition.json`
   - Name: `CHHHS Research Publications - Daily Ingestion & Enrichment`
   - Trigger: `Recurrence` daily at 20:00 UTC (06:00 AEST).
2. **Manifest Template Canonicalized:**
   - File: `config/flows/manifest.template.json`
   - Name: `CHHHS Research Publications - Daily Ingestion & Enrichment`
3. **Build Script & Deployable Package:**
   - Generator: `scripts/build_sharepoint_upsert_package.py` updated to inject the recurrence trigger.
   - Package: `private/ops/flow-packages/sharepoint-upsert.zip` generated and verified.
4. **Platform Handshake:**
   - The flow runs 1 hour prior to the dataset refresh at 07:00 AEST, ensuring the Power BI model consumes the latest daily SharePoint upserts.
